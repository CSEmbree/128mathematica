about Mathematica with a fun project


*******************************************************************
## 2. USAGE
*******************************************************************
Open _Mathematica_ and open the '128_game.nb' file.

Steps to play:

1. Run the 128 game by evaluating the "notebook" in '128_game.nb'
2. Select the generated field at the bottom of the notebook
3. Use the arrow keys to generated and move colored blocks

The game is over when a **black block** is generated.

game is over when a black block is created.
Colors are generated as follows:
